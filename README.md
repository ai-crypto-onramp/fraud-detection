# Fraud Detection
![CI](https://github.com/ai-crypto-onramp/fraud-detection/actions/workflows/ci.yml/badge.svg)

ML scoring on payment + behavioral signals (chargeback/velocity models); feeds the policy engine.

## Overview / Responsibilities

The Fraud Detection service is the ML-powered risk scoring layer of the crypto
on-ramp. It consumes payment and behavioral signals in real time, produces a
fraud risk score and risk band per transaction, and returns them to the
**Policy / Risk Engine** (the gatekeeper before MPC signing). It is a
"fast-follow" service in the launch sequence and hardens the platform against
chargeback, account-takeover, and velocity-based fraud.

Core responsibilities:

- Real-time fraud scoring on every payment + behavioral event.
- Maintaining chargeback risk and velocity anomaly models.
- Engineering and serving features (user, device, geolocation, payment history).
- Model versioning, A/B routing (champion/challenger), and retraining.
- Producing explainable scores (SHAP top features) for analysts and disputes.
- Closing the feedback loop by ingesting chargeback / fraud / clean outcomes.
- Emitting threshold-based alerts and an audit trail of every score.

## Language & Tech Stack

- **Language:** Python 3.11+
- **Web framework:** FastAPI (async REST + Kafka consumer workers)
- **ML:** scikit-learn, XGBoost; SHAP for explainability
- **Feature store:** Feast (online lookups via Redis)
- **Streaming:** Kafka consumer for `payment.*` and `chargeback.*` events
- **Model registry:** MLflow (model versions, stage transitions, A/B routing)
- **Storage:** PostgreSQL (scores, model versions, chargeback events)
- **Observability:** Prometheus metrics, OpenTelemetry traces, structured logs

## System Requirements

### Functional

- **Real-time scoring** on payment + behavioral signals, called synchronously on
  the transaction path and asynchronously via the event bus.
- **Chargeback risk model** estimating P(chargeback) for a given payment.
- **Velocity anomaly model** detecting unusual transaction frequency, amount, or
  breadth across cards/devices/IPs for a user or device cluster.
- **Device / fingerprint signals** ingestion (fingerprint hash, device type,
  rooted/emulator flags, known-bad device list).
- **Feature engineering pipeline** producing online + offline feature groups,
  backfilled from historical events and kept fresh from the stream.
- **Model versioning & A/B** — every model has a semantic version; traffic is
  split between champion and challenger via configurable routing.
- **Score explainability** — top contributing features per score via SHAP,
  returned in the API response and stored for audit.
- **Feedback loop** — chargeback, fraud-claim, and confirmed-clean outcomes are
  ingested as labels to retrain and evaluate models.
- **Threshold-based alerting** — scores above `SCORE_THRESHOLD_HIGH` trigger an
  immediate alert (to Policy Engine + notification); medium band routes to
  manual review queue.

### Non-Functional

| Requirement | Target |
|---|---|
| Score latency (p99) | < 200 ms |
| Feature lookup (p99) | < 50 ms |
| Model retrain cadence | daily (velocity) / weekly (chargeback) |
| Availability | 99.9% (scoring on transaction path) |
| Drift monitoring | PSI/KS drift checks on inputs + score distribution, daily |
| Throughput | ≥ 2,000 scores/sec sustained |
| Model rollback | < 5 min via MLflow stage transition |
| Score persistence | immutable, retained 7 years for compliance |

## Technical Specifications

### API Surface

Two surfaces:

1. **REST (synchronous)** — called inline by the Policy Engine on the
   transaction path. Must meet the p99 latency budget.
2. **Event bus (asynchronous)** — Kafka consumer ingests
   `payment.authorized`, `payment.captured`, `chargeback.received` and emits
   `fraud.scored` for downstream consumers.

### Data Model (PostgreSQL)

| Table | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `fraud_scores` | one row per score: `tx_id, user_id, score, risk_band, model_version, top_features(jsonb), scored_at` |
| `model_versions` | registered models: `name, version, stage (champion/challenger/archived), metrics(jsonb), trained_at` |
| `feature_values` | online-feature snapshot per score (for replay/debug): `tx_id, feature_group, payload(jsonb)` |
| `chargeback_events` | feedback labels: `tx_id, outcome, reason_code, reported_at, source` |

### Feature Groups (Feast)

| Feature group | Example features |
|---|---|
| `user_velocity` | tx count/sum last 1h, 24h, 7d; distinct cards/devices/IPs |
| `device` | fingerprint hash, new-to-user flag, known-bad flag, emulator/rooted |
| `geolocation` | IP country, distance from billing, VPN/proxy flag, geo-velocity |
| `payment_history` | success/fail ratio, avg ticket, first-payment age |
| `chargeback_history` | user chargeback rate 30d/90d, device chargeback rate |

### Integrations

| Direction | Channel | Counterparty | Payload |
|---|---|---|---|
| Consumes | Kafka `payment.authorized` / `payment.captured` | Payment Orchestration | payment + device + behavioral signals |
| Consumes | Kafka `chargeback.received` (webhook normalize by Rail Connectors) | Rail Connectors | chargeback reason, amount, tx ref |
| Emits | Kafka `fraud.scored` | Policy / Risk Engine | score, risk_band, model_version |
| Emits | Kafka `fraud.alert.raised` | Notification + ops | high-band alerts |
| Emits | Kafka `fraud.audit` | Audit / Event Log | every score (immutable) |
| Reads | REST (sync) | Feature Store (Feast/Redis) | online features |
| Reads/Writes | REST | MLflow Model Registry | model versions, stage transitions |

### ML Ops

- **Model registry (MLflow):** every trained model is logged with params,
  metrics (AUC, PR-AUC, calibration), and the feature snapshot URI. Stage
  transitions (`staging → champion → archived`) are audited.
- **A/B routing:** the service resolves the active split per model name from
  the registry and routes by stable hash of `tx_id`.
- **Champion / challenger:** challenger receives a configurable fraction of
  traffic; its offline + online metrics are compared before promotion.
- **Retraining:** scheduled jobs (daily for velocity, weekly for chargeback)
  pull labeled `chargeback_events` since the last run, retrain, and register a
  candidate. Promotion requires a human approval gate.
- **Drift monitoring:** daily PSI/KS tests on input features and score
  distribution per model; breaches open an alert and can trigger retraining.
- **Rollback:** reverting a champion is a single MLflow stage transition; the
  service hot-reloads the active version map.
